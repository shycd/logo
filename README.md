# SHYCD's Logo
- All files are being edited with Inkscape on Ubuntu 18.04.2

18-7-2019: Vectorization finished.

Why the aureola? For aesthetic reasons and representing a "crown".

What is our inspiration?
Our logo is inspired on Anonymous logo and it takes elements of a prior banner made by me back in 2010.
We made this in sympathy with what we seen in that moment was the activists activity.

What is SHYCD?
A hacking community with a focus on projects that can make a positive social impact.
Was founded on January 24, 2011 in Dolores, Uruguay.
